<p>New site, new first post! This should give me an opportunity to test and work with Jekyll’s capabilities,
as well as the flexibility that Markdown offers. I hope to keep this going, because I need a place to express
and share ideas and musings that isn’t just Twitter… I constantly just end up retweeting EVERYTHING! :)</p>
